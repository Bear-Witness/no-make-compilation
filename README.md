# No make code compilation


This is a repo to make a manual compilation of some C code inside
a project.

It is obviously not even slightly scalable, as it would be
with make. But I think this should be the first way to teach how
to compile C code, as make obfuscates quite a lot the compiler
itself, which is the thing, in my experience, with which  the most
trouble appears.
